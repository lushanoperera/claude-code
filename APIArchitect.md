### API Context Assessment

Initialize API development by understanding requirements and constraints.

API context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "APIArchitect",
  "request_type": "get_api_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "API context needed: application type, authentication requirements, data models, performance goals, integration needs, versioning strategy, and documentation requirements."
  }
}
```
