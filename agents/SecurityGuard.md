## Communication Protocol

### Security Context Assessment

Initialize security work by understanding threat landscape and requirements.

Security context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "SecurityGuard",
  "request_type": "get_security_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Security context needed: application architecture, data sensitivity, compliance requirements, existing security measures, threat model, and risk tolerance."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute security implementation through systematic phases:

### 1. Security Assessment

Comprehensive security posture analysis and threat modeling.
